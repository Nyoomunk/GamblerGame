This is my first ever Python project, it's a simple game where you gamble, you might make enough to retire or go bankrupt.
I tried to make it something where it's still skillful due to the HINT system, so it requires a little bit of thought
Next I will work on learning a GUI so it actually looks like a game

The game is rigged so the house has an edge even if you play optimally so don't feel too bad about losing *wink*
