This is my first ever Python project, it's a simple game where you gamble, you might make enough to retire or go bankrupt.

I tried to make it something where it's still sorta skillful due to the hint system, so it requires at least a little bit of thought. A smart human will beat random guessing.

Next I will work on learning a GUI so it actually looks like a game

The game is rigged so the house has an edge even if you play optimally so don't feel too bad about losing *wink* this is a metaphor how much money I lose opening Pok√©mon packs

Have fun playing my skinnerbox!
