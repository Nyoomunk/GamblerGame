This is my first ever Python project, it's a simple game where you gamble, you might make enough to retire or go bankrupt.

I tried to make it something where it's still sorta skillful due to the hint system, so it requires at least a little bit of thought. A smart human will beat random guessing.

Next I will work on learning a GUI so it actually looks like a game

The game is rigged so the house has an edge even if you play optimally so don't feel too bad about losing *wink* this is a metaphor how much money I lose opening Pok√©mon packs

EDIT: I just realised I did the initial math wrong
You actually gain about 0.4 coins every cycle with perfect strategy
So the game is not rigged in favour of ''the house''


Have fun playing my skinnerbox!
